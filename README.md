(**Please be careful on the Mainnet! First, test and understand everything on the Devnet.**)

The buildo.dev app is a port of the [CLI](https://github.com/xdevguild/buildo-begins) functionality. So you can use both. In time, the functionality will probably differ a bit. Web app will have more possibilities.

The app is built using two core tools which you can also use:
- [useElven](https://www.useElven.com) - React.js hooks for interaction with the MultiversX blockchain
- [Next.js Dapp Template](https://github.com/xdevguild/nextjs-dapp-template) - The ready-to-use Next.js app template built with Tailwind and Next.js App Router architecture

The app will help to improve these tools. While building, I found a couple of bugs and created to-do items for future improvements, mainly in useElven.

### What's included

- The app can issue and manage many different token types within the MultiversX blockchain ecosystem
- The app can also help with general blockchain interactions
- It has a couple of helpful utilities and will get more.

You'll find the list of functionalities on the homepage.

Please check the [About](https://www.buildo.dev/about) section to read more about how to contribute and the next steps - a high-level roadmap.

### Development

It will run with self signed SSL. It enables encrypted HTTPS connections but is not inherently trusted by browsers or systems, requiring manual trust configuration. Some MultiversX signing providers require HTTPS even for localhost.

`npx buildo-begins@latest init` - from the list, choose Buildo.dev dapp.

Or you can do this manually:
- Clone the repository
- Copy the `.env.example` to `.env.local` (modify if needed)
- Run `npm run dev`
- Please report [issues](https://github.com/xdevguild/buildo.dev/issues)
- [Kanban board](https://github.com/orgs/xdevguild/projects/3)
